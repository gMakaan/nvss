# NVerSS - Nested Version Semantic String - Semantic version string with inheritance

NVSS - Standardization of object versioning. A pocket analogue of Git or Svn, where only the version string itself is controlled and standartized, not the content itself. When an object changes, its version string changes in accordance with NVSS rules.

* **No version conflicts when working on copies of the same object in parallel**.
* Full support for [SemVer](https://semver.org).
* Support for unlimited inheritance of version modifications.
* Support for branches.
* Availability of addresses and scope of rights for authors of versions.
* Human readable syntax. Adapted for handmade.

NVSS is optimized for manual versioning, which allows you to use this system where full-fledged version control systems are redundant or uncomfortable.

Example:

* individual files, templates, documents, each with their own version
* parallel work/review of printed documents
* work with graphic content
